# ML-based-Energy-Consumption-Prediction
The code is an LSTM Recurrent Neural Network that predicts energy consumption based on the usage over the past 60 days. 
The code uses a time series LSTM to predict the power after every 60 days of energy consumption. 
The required dataset can be found in PowerAep2.csv
This dataset has been made by editting the National Tata Global Dataset.
